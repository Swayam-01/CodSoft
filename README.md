What all this repo contain
1. Calculator
For the Calculator project, I created a simple yet functional graphical calculator using Python and Tkinter. I designed a user-friendly interface with buttons for digits, operators (like +, -, *, /), and a display area to show input and results. The functionality was implemented by binding the button presses to Python functions that perform the corresponding arithmetic operations. Tkinter's Entry widget was used to create the input/output display, while each button was assigned a command to execute its respective action. Exception handling was also added to deal with errors like division by zero.

2. Password Generator
In the Password Generator project, I built a secure password generator with an easy-to-use interface. Using Tkinter, I designed an input area where the user can specify the desired password length and click a button to generate the password. The password was generated using Python's random module, which combines letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters for enhanced security. The generated password is then displayed in a label on the interface, and the user can easily copy it to the clipboard.

3. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
For the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, I created an interactive game where the user can play against the computer. The user selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors from the Tkinter buttons, and the computer randomly picks one as well. The game logic, implemented using Pythonâ€™s random module, compares the choices to determine the winner. The result of the game (win, lose, or tie) is displayed on the interface using labels, and the game keeps track of scores as it progresses. I also included buttons to reset the game and start a new round.
